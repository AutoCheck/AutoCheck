/// This module deals with simplifying counter-examples. A property fails when
/// LightCheck finds a first counter-example. However, randomly-generated data
/// typically contains a lot of noise. Therefore it is a good idea to simplify
/// counter-examples before reporting them. This process is called shrinking.
